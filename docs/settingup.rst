Setting-up a Thermodynamic Calculation

Basic Use
#########
In this tutorial we will assume the user is creating the necessary files for the python module use of this package (rather than as an imported library). A basic calculation requires 2 files:

 #. `input.json`: Contains a dictionary of instructions and settings.
 #. `EOSgroup.json`: A dictionary of single group parameters used in the desired equation of state (EOS).

For this example we focus on carbon dioxide and water modeled with the SAFT-:math:`\gamma`-Mie EOS found in the `examples` directory.

`input_vapor.json`::

    {
        "bead_configuration": [[["CO2", 1]], [["H2O", 1]]],
        "EOSgroup": "SAFTgroup.json",
        "EOScross": "SAFTcross.json",
        "calculation_type" : "vapor_properties",
        "Tlist" : [323.2],
        "yilist": [[0.9954, 0.0046]],
        "Plist": [4492927.45]
    }

Notice that the name of this file doesn't really matter, but we use the prefix *input* to denote where these instructions are. This file is processed by the :func:`~despasito.input_output.read_input.extract_calc_data` function.

The first three lines are used in producing our EOS object. The `bead_config` line is an list of system components. Each components is defined as a list of group (i.e. segment or bead) types. Each of those groups is then a list of the bead name followed by the number of beads in the components. Notice that connectivity isn't captured by SAFT in this way. The next file, `EOSgroup.json`, contains the self-interaction parameters of a certain group. The optional file, `EOScross.json`, then contains any cross interaction parameters. If it isn't provided, then the EOS object will estimate these interactions with the defined mixing rules. The default EOS is SAFT-:math:`\gamma`-Mie, but any other EOS can be added to DESPASITO using our class interface. Specifying another EOS is explained in, :func:`~despasito.equations_of_state.initiate_eos`. That being said, because this package is based on SAFT, the `association_site_names` can also be defined as a line here.

The last 4 lines for thermodynamic calculation instructions, although only `calculation_type` is actually required. The other lines depend on the calculation type being used. In this case, defining the pressure is optional, if it was missing DESPASITO would assume atmospheric pressure.

See :ref:`calculation-types` for a list of available types of thermodynamic calculations.

`EOSgroup.json`::
    
    {
        "CO2": {
            "epsilon": 207.891,
            "l_a": 5.0550,
            "l_r": 26.408,
            "sigma": 3.05e-10,
            "Sk": 0.84680,
            "Vks": 2,
            "mass": 0.04401,
             "NkH": 1,
             "Nka1": 1
        },
        "H2O": {
            "epsilon": 266.68,
            "l_a": 6.0,
            "l_r": 17.020,
            "sigma": 3.0063e-10,
            "Sk": 1.0,
            "Vks": 1,
            "mass": 0.018015,
            "NkH": 2,
            "Nke1": 2,
            "epsilonHe1": 1985.4,
            "KHe1": 101.69e-30
        }
    }

In the `EOSgroup.json` file, As many, groups as desired may be defined. Those used in the calculation are specified in the `bead_config` line. The parameter keys used are defined in the documentation for the chosen EOS object. As an example, the cross-interactions can be defined as follows:

`EOScross.json`::

    {
        "CO2": {
            "H2O": {"epsilon": 226.38, "epsilonHe1":2200.0, "KHe1":91.419e-30}
    }

After creating each of these files, go ahead and run the calculation with:
`python -m despasito -i input_vapor.json -vv`, 
It's that easy!

Referencing a Library of Parameters
###################################

If you checked our examples folder in DESPASITO, you might have noticed that they don't quite match the files above. You can actually make this process even easier by eliminating the need to make and `EOSgroup.json` and `EOScross.json` file for every calculation by having one file with all parameters, that's what we did. This can be accomplished by keeping the file in one location and providing DESPASITO with the path in one of two ways:

 #. In the string within input.json, include a absolute or relative path to the file.
 #. In the command line, include the `-p` option to define the absolute or relative path.

Other options for controlling the output are also available in the command line implementation. Type `python -m despasito -h` to discover more.

Specifying Equation of State (EOS)
##################################

By default, DESPASITO used the SAFT-:math:`\gamma`-Mie equation of state. However, you can change the EOS by adding the "eos" option to the `input.json` file. This option is passed to the :func:`~despasito.equations_of_state.initiate_eos` function, an example of this can be found in the Peng-Robinson calculations in the `examples` directory. The syntax for an equation of state is module.eos, where module is the family the eos belongs to, and eos is the equation of state. For Peng-Robinson this entry would be,

    "eos": "cubic.peng_robinson"

and for SAFT-:math:`\gamma`-Mie,

    "eos": "saft.gamma_mie"

See :ref:`EOS-types` for a list of available equations of state.
